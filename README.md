# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

**Link to Dataset:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

### Situation
> Financial institutions face significant losses from credit card fraud. \
> Traditional detection methods were insufficient. \
> Large volume of transactions (280K+) needed real-time analysis.

### Task
> Build a machine learning system to detect fraudulent transactions. \
> Improve detection accuracy while minimizing false positives. \
> Handle imbalanced dataset where fraud cases are rare.

### Action
> Conducted extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering. \
> Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. \
> Applied sampling techniques to address class imbalance. \
> Performed hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation. \
> Optimized models for real-world application.

### Result
> Achieved 0.99 AUPRC score in fraud detection. \
> Improved Recall by 2%. \
> Reached 94% fraud detection accuracy. \
> Reduced financial losses through better detection. \
> Created a scalable solution for ongoing fraud detection.
